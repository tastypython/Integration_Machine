# Integration_Machine
Project for While Loops

Given a real valued function 
y=f(x) 

write code to find the integral of y from x=xo to x=x1 where xo and x1 are 
user input.
use a while loop to do the intergation.
Print the result and compare your answer by actually finding the integral.
How can you increase the accuracy of the result ?
